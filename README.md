## Description  ðŸ“‹

The project consists of the development of a social media web application with functionalities and design lines based on actual paradigms of the market's leading platforms. **Appwrite** has been used as a backend as a service, establishing a solid and scalable base by using its diferent modules, like the databases or authentication system. The dynamic user interface was created using **React** as the main framework, with technologies such as **React-Query** (now TanStack Query) for efficient state management. On the other hand, the styling has been implemented with the **RadixUI** based library **Shadcn**, and customizing it's components with **TailwindCSS**, offering a clean and elegant appearance.
